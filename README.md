Context: This is a practice projet to get more used to data science, working around given data for specifically checking the likelyhood of an insurance claim being fraudulent

Actions: I wrote up the code and made sure that it ignores empty values, tallies a score for every individual insurance claim in the data, and that when finally printing out, it presents only the cases with highest minimum fraud score.

Results:
Potential Fraud Cases:
Index: 0, Policy Number: 521585, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 3, Policy Number: 227811, Fraud Score: 4
Index: 5, Policy Number: 104594, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 10, Policy Number: 543610, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 12, Policy Number: 842643, Fraud Score: 4
Index: 15, Policy Number: 892874, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 17, Policy Number: 275265, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 18, Policy Number: 921202, Fraud Score: 4
Index: 19, Policy Number: 143972, Fraud Score: 3
Index: 23, Policy Number: 115399, Fraud Score: 3
And more indexes.

Growth/Next steps: To lern how to be more adaptable and easily change around this code itself for any similiar talying usages of data.
